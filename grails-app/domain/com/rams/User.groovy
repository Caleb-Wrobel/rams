	/*
	 * We require certain information to be entered on first log in
	 * I left this up to logic guy to implement but I would propose
	 * a general format for the constraint for such an attribute
	 * 
	 * <field>(blank:true,
	 * 		validator {<field>,user ->
	 * 			if (!brandNew){
	 * 				return true

	 * 					return true
	 * 				}
	 * 			}
	 * 		}
	 * 		)
	 * 
	 * This code (when written properly) should generally allow <field>
	 * to be an empty string (which i think is meant by "blank" but if
	 * the user is not newly created (first time they log in, we must
	 * set brandNew to true in the logic) the field may not be blank
